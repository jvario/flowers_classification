# I.  Introduction:

#### Project Overview:
The main objective of this project is to make a model that recognize different species of flowers, given its attributes. Several subtasks can be spawned from this objective. The main categories are:

	● Load and preprocess the image dataset.
	
	● Train the image classifier based on dataset.
	
	● Use the trained classifier to predict image content
	
#### Dataset:
The dataset is provided [here](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) and contains various species of flowers.
